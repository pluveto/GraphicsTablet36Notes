/*
The following is a list of page and usage codes.

1. The format of PAGE entries is:

PAGE xx longname,variableprefix

  Where,
    xx             - Is the page number in hex
    longname       - Is the long name of the page
    variableprefix - Is the prefix applied to generated C variable
                     names of usages within this page

2. The format of any USAGE entries under each PAGE entry is:

xx longname[,datatype[,shortname]]

  Where,
    xx             - Is the usage number (within this page) in hex
    longname       - Is the long name of the usage
    datatype       - Is the data type of the usage:
                     BB       = Buffered Bytes
                     CA       = Application Collection
                     CACP     = Application or Physical Collection
                     CL       = Logical Collection
                     CP       = Physical Collection
                     DF       = Dynamic Flag
                     DV       = Dynamic Value
                     DVDF     = Dynamic Value/Flag
                     LC       = Linear Control
                     MC       = Momentary Control
                     MCDV     = Momentary Control/Dynamic Value
                     NAry     = Named Array
                     OOC      = On/Off Control
                     OSC      = One Shot Control
                     OSC-NAry = One Shot Control/Named Array
                     RTC      = Re-trigger Control
                     MULTI    = Selector, On/Off, Momentary, or One Shot
                     Sel      = Selector
                     SF       = Static Flag
                     SFDF     = Static Flag or Dynamic Flag
                     SFDFSEL  = Static/Dynamic Flag or Selector
                     SV       = Static Value
                     SVDV     = Static Value or Dynamic Value
                     UM       = Usage Modifier
                     US       = Usage Switch
    shortname      - Is normally derived from "longname" by removing spaces,
                     but occasionally the "longname" contains special characters that
                     can't easily be converted to a short name (which is used to name 
                     variables in C structure definitions) so "shortname", if 
                     present, is used instead. 

If you have any other usage codes to be defined, then you can either
include them explicitly by specifying the command-line option:

  --include [filename]

...or, have them loaded on demand by storing them in a file called:

  xxxx.conf

...where xxxx is the usage page in uppercase hexadecimal. 

The default usage page definition file is called rd.conf which is
always read first, and will be merged with any file that you
explicitly include or for which an xxxx.conf file exists.
