| A.8 A Device with a Display

| The following example is of a 2x16-character display device. The device uses one Feature, one Input, and
| two Output reports.

| A Feature report is declared for identifying fixed features of the display and display status. All of the
| Feature reportâ€™s fields are constants.

| The Character Spacing usage is not declared, so it can be assumed that the respective inter-character spacing
| is forced by the pixel layout of the display, and any downloaded font characters do not have to include it.
| In this example, the Character Height and Width are fixed. The fields are declared in the Report descriptor
| and the actual values are reported when the Feature report is read. For example, the Character Height and
| Width fields will always return 7 and 5, respectively.

| Uploading of the font is not supported by this display so there is no Font Report Input report.

| The first report defined is a Feature report with seven fields. The Rows, Columns, Character Height and
| Width fields are Static Values (SV) and their report size is set to 5 to demonstrate how the bit packing takes
| place in a report. Standard Character Set, Data Read Back and Vertical Scroll are Static Flags (SF).

| The following Character Attributes collection defines a byte where bits 0, 1, and 2 define Enhance,
| Underline, and Blink attributes that can be applied to a character. The remaining bits in the byte pad it to a
| byte boundary and ignored by the display. Modifying the fields defined in this collection will have no effect
| on the display. They simply form a template that is used to define the contents of a Attribute Data report.

| The second report defined is an Input report that is generated on the interrupt endpoint each time the status
| of the display changes. Each of the possible states that can be identified by the display are identified in the
| Display Status collection. This report can also be read over the control pipe to determine the current status.

| There are a number of ways that data can be transferred between the host and the display: one byte at a time,
| multiple bytes, or the whole screen using a 32-byte buffered-byte transfer. The choice may depend on
| whether the device is implemented as a low-speed or a high-speed device. In this example, a third Feature
| report is defined for writing up to four sequential characters from the display in a single report. Note that the
| Data Read Back usage is not declared in the Report descriptor, which implies that the display character data
| is write-only

| The following Character Report contains 2, 4 byte fields, one for character data and another for character
| attributes. Each allow 4 characters to be modified simultaneously.

| A fourth Feature report is defined for updating the font. The Display Data field identifies the character to be
| modified. Because Character Height = 7 and Character Width = 5, 35 bits will be required for a font
| character. A 40-bit buffered-byte field (5x8) is declared to contain the font data. Note that the Data Read
| Back usage is not declared in the Report descriptor, which implies that the display font data is write-only.
